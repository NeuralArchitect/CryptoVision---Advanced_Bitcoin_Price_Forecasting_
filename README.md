# CryptoVision : Advanced Bitcoin Price Forecasting

Here I have tried these many model for time series forecasting on Bitcoin dataset from 17-7-2010 to 9-9-2024

0. Naive Forecast
1. Moving Average
2. ARIMA
3. sktime
4. Tensorflow Decision Forests (Random forest, gradient boosting trees)
5. Facebook Kats
6. Linkedin Greykite
7. Dense Model
8. Same as 1
9. Same as 1
10. Conv1D
11. LSTM
12. Same as 1 but multivariate
13. N-BEATs Algorithm
14. Ensemble 
15. Future Prediction model
16. Same as 1 but with turkey data introduced
